In India , there are over 3.5 crore cases pending in the court, also there are over 2.4 lakhs rape cases pending. The main problem with the people being upset over the government and the system is the way justice is dealt. For example, sometimes it so happens that a pickpocket case gets solved within two hearing of court, at maximum, whereas a severe offence such as a generic rape case gets prolonged on and other cases get accumulated over this case and justice eventually gets delayed. The common man instead of figuring out how the present system works, call names on the system along with the present ruling government. It takes around 8-10 years for the court to announce its decision on severe and offence cases like rape cases, murder cases because there is nothing in the Indian judiciary to calculate the severity of the case.
During this all, the all blame goes onto the court, judges, lawyer, although they are not at any fault. 

The problem is with the judiciary system which cannot prioritizing the cases according to  their severity level.
This means, that the cases (either it be a normal robbery case or some serious rape/murder case) in the judiciary system are not classified by their level severity, that is the reason why is takes a murder case or a rape case 8-10  years for the court to announce its decision, while it just takes 2-3 months for a robbery case to get solved.

We as a team worked hard and came up an amazing idea which we named ProBono app.
An app which assists the court in prioritizing which cases to take up first in order of severity. This app allows lawyers to safeguard evidence and case files by digitizing them and giving easy access to the lawyers and courtroom officials. In this way justice wonâ€™t get delayed and there is a reduced risk of tampering with evidence.
This application comprises of two portals, one is for the judge and the other is for the lawyers. So, this app basically arranges all the cases to be taken up on a day in the order of severity of the offence and displays the same on the judge portal. This app also gives the ability to the lawyers to store their evidence safe and secure in their own portal.
